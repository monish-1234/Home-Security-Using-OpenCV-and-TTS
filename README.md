# Home Security using OpenCV and TTS

This is a code developed from @ageitgey's face_recognition's example code.<br>
PYTTSX3 TTS Engine is used for Voice.<br>

<br><br><br>
This code can be used to prevent unauthorised person from entry.(Ofcourse just a picture of that person is enough to gain entry.)<br>
This is not the perfect security system , but it's a start.<br>
Feel free to edit and develop more from this code.<br>
