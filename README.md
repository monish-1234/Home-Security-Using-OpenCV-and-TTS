# Home Security using OpenCV and TTS

This is a code developed from @ageitgey's face_recognition's example code.
PYTTSX3 TTS Engine is used for Voice.

This code can be used to prevent unauthorised person from entry.(Ofcourse just a picture of that person is enough to gain entry.)
This is not the perfect security system , but it's a start.
Feel free to edit and develop more from this code.
